        <a href="https://bookshop.org/shop/townbookstore" target="_blank">Bookshop.org storefront</a>. 
        Please note that Bookshop.org is a separate platform — books ordered there are shipped to you 
        and not pulled from our in-store inventory. You’ll still be supporting our store with every purchase!</p>
